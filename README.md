Thank you for participating in the Outliant Laravel Engineer Interview
For today's coding challenge you will need to build a simple calculator app
You will need to clone the codebase from GitHub and then set up the project on your local machine
When you visit the root URL of the project, you will be seeing a calculator UI, and you job is to 
complete the functionality of the calculator so that it can be used to do simple calculations like:
a + b, a * b, a - b, and a / b, where a and b are numbers, and the correct output will be displayed
in the input field.
Your interviewer will verify the result at the end of the interview
